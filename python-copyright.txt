Most Python sources and binaries are distributed under the following copyright. A few files have a different copyright owner, but otherwise the notice is similar.

The gist of it is that Python is absolutely free, even for commercial use (including resale). There is no GNU-like "copyleft" restriction.

A clarification: some very picky lawyers are worried that the notice doesn't explicitly grant permission to distribute modified copies (even though it grants permission to copy, modify, and distribute). This can be considered an oversight in the notice; we have no intention to limit distribution of modified copies (that otherwise play by the rules). Similarly, the words "without fee" are to be read connected to "permission": permission is granted without fee. We are in the process of revising the notice to clarify it, but this is a slow process.

Another clarification: the limitation of the copyright to 1991-1995 in the notice is not a mistake, but rather a deliberate decision. Copyright applies regardless of whether it is explicitly stated or not.

News: The Open Source Initiative board has voted to certify the Python license as Open Source.

And if you had to ask, yes, this license is compatible with the GPL (sez RMS).
